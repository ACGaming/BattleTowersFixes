# Battle Towers Fixes

*Minimally invasive fixes for Battle Towers*

* Customizable battle towers via config file
* Fixed loot chests with custom loot tables
* Possibility of utilizing namespaced loot tables
* Faster world loading (*inspired* by VanillaFix, LOL)
* Blacklist for block destruction on tower collapse
* *Planned: Difficulty persistent tower golems (no despawning in peaceful mode)*
